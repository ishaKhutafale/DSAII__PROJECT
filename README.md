  The concept of "Six Degrees of Separation" proposes that any two
people on Earth are connected through a chain of, at most, six
social connections. In simpler terms, it suggests that you can
reach anyone in the world through a series of mutual
acquaintances or friends, with no more than six intermediaries
between you and them.For instance, if you know Person A, and Person A knows Person B,
who knows Person C, and so on, you can theoretically connect to
Person Z through a maximum of six links.</p>
<p>
Our project aims to delve into this fascinating concept, exploring
how social networks function and how they shape our
interactions.By focusing on bidirectional BFS, we've demonstrated its
efficiency in uncovering connections.</p>
